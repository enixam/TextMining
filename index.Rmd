# Preface {-}  


This book grew out of my learning experience and notes concerning [Text Mining with R: A Tidy Approach](https://www.tidytextmining.com/) by Julia Silge and David Robinson.  

`tidyverse` and `tidytext` are automatically loaded before each chapter: 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidytext)
```
