# Converting to and from non-tidy formats    


```{r}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache = TRUE)
```


Non-tidy data structures, in particular matrcies, is essential in topic modeling where other packages for NLP in R play a major role. 

The book has a diagram describing the "glue" part functions in this chapter play:  

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "120%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/non-tidy.png")
```

As shown in the figure, **a tidied DTM is typically equivalent with a per-token-per-document-per-row data frame after counting**.  

## Tidying a document-term matrix  

A document-term matrix or term-document matrix is a mathematical matrix that describes the frequency of terms that occur in a collection of documents. This is a matrix where 

- each row represents one document  

- each column represents one term (word)  

- each value (typically) contains the number of appearances of that term in that document  


Document-term matrices are often stored as a sparse matrix object. These objects can be treated as though they were matrices (for example, accessing particular rows and columns), but are stored in a more efficient format.  

`tidytext` provides ways of converting between these two formats:  

- `tidy()` turns a document-term matrix into a tidy data frame (one-token-per-document-per-row)

- `cast()` turns a tidy data frame into a matrix.There are three variations of this verb corresponding to different classes of matricies : `cast_sparse()` (converting to a sparse matrix from the `Matrix` package), `cast_dtm()` (converting to a `DocumentTermMatrix` object from `tm`), and `cast_dfm()` (converting to a `dfm` object from quanteda)  


`DocumentTermMatrix` class is built into the `tm` package. Notice that this DTM is 99% sparse (99% of document-word pairs are zero). 

```{r}
library(tm)
library(topicmodels)
data("AssociatedPress", package = "topicmodels")

AssociatedPress
# convert to tidy data frames with counts
tidy(AssociatedPress)
```

```{r}

```

`Terms()` is a accessor function to extract the full distinct word vector  

```{r}
Terms(AssociatedPress) %>% head()
```


`quanteda` uses `dfm` (document-feauture matrix) as a common data structure for text data. For example, the `quanteda` package comes with a corpus of presidential inauguration speeches, which can be converted to a dfm using the appropriate function. 

```{r}
data("data_corpus_inaugural", package = "quanteda")
quanteda::dfm(data_corpus_inaugural)
```

We, of course, want to `tidy` it  

```{r}
inaugural <- quanteda::dfm(data_corpus_inaugural) %>% 
  tidy()

inaugural
```

Suppose we would like to see how the usage of some user specified words change over time. We start by `complete()` the data frame, and then total words per speech:   

```{r}
year_term_counts <- inaugural %>% 
  extract(document, into = "year", regex = "(\\d{4})", convert = TRUE) %>% 
  complete(year, term, fill = list(count = 0)) %>% 
  add_count(year, wt = count, name = "year_total")

year_term_counts
```



```{r, fig.height = 8, fig.width = 8}
year_term_counts %>%
  filter(term %in% c("god", "america", "foreign", "union", "constitution", "freedom")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(year, count / year_total)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() +
  facet_wrap(~ term, scales = "free_y") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) +
  lab(title = "% frequency of word in inaugural address")
```
