# Converting to and from non-tidy formats    


```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache = TRUE)
```


Non-tidy data structures, in particular matrcies, is essential in topic modeling where other packages for NLP in R play a major role. 

The book has a diagram describing the "glue" part functions in this chapter play:  

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "120%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/non-tidy.png")
```

As shown in the figure, **a tidied DTM is typically equivalent with a one-token-per-row data frame after counting**.  

## Tidying a document-term matrix  

A document-term matrix or term-document matrix is a mathematical matrix that describes the frequency of terms that occur in a collection of documents. This is a matrix where 

- each row represents one document  

- each column represents one term (word)  

- each value (typically) contains the number of appearances of that term in that document  


Document-term matrices are often stored as a sparse matrix object. These objects can be treated as though they were matrices (for example, accessing particular rows and columns), but are stored in a more efficient format.  

`tidytext` provides ways of converting between these two formats:  

- `tidy()` turns a document-term matrix into a tidy data frame (one-token-per-row)

- `cast()` turns a tidy data frame into a matrix.There are three variations of this verb corresponding to different classes of matricies : `cast_sparse()` (converting to a sparse matrix from the `Matrix` package), `cast_dtm()` (converting to a `DocumentTermMatrix` object from `tm`), and `cast_dfm()` (converting to a `dfm` object from quanteda)  


`DocumentTermMatrix` class is built into the `tm` package. Notice that this DTM is 99% sparse (99% of document-word pairs are zero). 

```{r}
library(tm)
library(topicmodels)
data("AssociatedPress", package = "topicmodels")

AssociatedPress
```

`Terms()` is a accessor function to extract the full distinct word vector  

```{r}
Terms(AssociatedPress) %>% head()
```


`tidy` it to get a tidy data frame 

```{r}
# convert to tidy data frames with counts
ap_tidy <- tidy(AssociatedPress)
ap_tidy
```



`quanteda` uses `dfm` (document-feauture matrix) as a common data structure for text data. For example, the `quanteda` package comes with a corpus of presidential inauguration speeches, which can be converted to a dfm using the appropriate function. 

```{r}
data("data_corpus_inaugural", package = "quanteda")
quanteda::dfm(data_corpus_inaugural)
```

We, of course, want to `tidy` it  

```{r}
inaugural <- quanteda::dfm(data_corpus_inaugural) %>% 
  tidy()

inaugural
```

Suppose we would like to see how the usage of some user specified words change over time. We start by `complete()` the data frame, and then total words per speech:   

```{r}
year_term_counts <- inaugural %>% 
  extract(document, into = "year", regex = "(\\d{4})", convert = TRUE) %>% 
  complete(year, term, fill = list(count = 0)) %>% 
  add_count(year, wt = count, name = "year_total")

year_term_counts
```



```{r, fig.height = 8, fig.width = 8}
year_term_counts %>%
  filter(term %in% c("god", "america", "foreign", "union", "constitution", "freedom")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(year, count / year_total)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() +
  facet_wrap(~ term, scales = "free_y") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) +
  labs(title = "% frequency of word in inaugural address")
```

## Casting tidy text data into a matrix  

`csat_` verbs convert a tidy data frame (counted) into a document-term matrix  

```{r}
ap_tidy %>%
  cast_dtm(document = document, term = term, value = count)
```

Similarly, we could cast `ap_tidy` into a `dfm` object from `quanteda`â€™s docuemnt term matrix with `cast_dfm()`  

```{r}
ap_tidy %>% 
  cast_dfm(document = document, term = term, value = count)
```

`cast_sparse` returns a sparse matrix 

```{r}
ap_tidy %>% 
  cast_sparse(row = document, column = term, value = count)
```

## Tidying corpus objects with metadata  

Notwithstanding discrepancies in their form, document term matrix and one-token-per-row data frame are exchangable for they both store the same information after tokenization. A corpus object, however, is a data structure for text data **before** tokenization.  One common example is Corpus objects from the tm package. These store text alongside **metadata**, which may include an ID, date/time, title, or language for each document.

The `tm` package comes with the `acq` corpus, containing 50 articles from the news service Reuters.  
```{r}
data("acq")
acq
```


A corpus object is structured like a list, with each item containing both text and metadata, wh.  

```{r}
acq[[1]]
acq[[1]]$content
acq[[1]]$meta
```



We can thus use the `tidy()` method to construct a table with one row per document, including the metadata  

```{r}
acq_tidy <- tidy(acq)
acq_tidy
```
